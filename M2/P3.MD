## Problem 3

In a city, 20% of the population is elderly (age 65 or above). Among the elderly population, 70% have a cat. Only 10% of the younger population (under 65) have a cat. If a person is selected randomly and is known to have a cat, what is the probability that this person is elderly?

### Solution:

Let:
- `P(E)` be the probability of being elderly (20% or 0.20).
- `P(Y)` be the probability of being younger (under 65) (80% or 0.80).
- `P(C|E)` be the probability of having a cat given the person is elderly (70% or 0.70).
- `P(C|Y)` be the probability of having a cat given the person is younger (10% or 0.10).

The probability of a person being elderly given that they have a cat (`P(E|C)`) can be calculated using the formula:

\[ P(E|C) = \frac{P(C|E) \times P(E)}{P(C|E) \times P(E) + P(C|Y) \times P(Y)} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ P(E|C) = \frac{0.70 \times 0.20}{0.70 \times 0.20 + 0.10 \times 0.80} = \frac{0.14}{0.22} \approx 0.6364 \]

So, the probability that a randomly selected person, known to have a cat, is elderly is approximately 63.64%.
