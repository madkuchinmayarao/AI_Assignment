## Problem 2



**Question:** If a randomly selected defective product is found, what is the probability that it is of type A?

### Solution:

Let:
- `P(A)` be the probability of having type A product (60% or 0.60).
- `P(B)` be the probability of having type B product (40% or 0.40).
- `P(D|A)` be the probability of being defective given it's type A (5% or 0.05).
- `P(D|B)` be the probability of being defective given it's type B (10% or 0.10).

The probability of a defective product being of type A (`P(A|D)`) can be calculated using the formula:

P(A|D) = { P(D|A) * P(A) } / { P(D|A) * P(A) + P(D|B) * P(B) } 

Substituting the given values:

P(A|D) = { 0.05 * 0.60 } / { 0.05 * 0.60 + 0.10 * 0.40 } = 0.03 / 0.07  

       = 0.4286 

So, the probability that a randomly selected defective product is of type A is approximately 42.86%.
