## Problem 1

In a school, 30% of students play basketball, 40% play soccer, and 20% play both basketball and soccer. If a student is chosen randomly and is known to play soccer, what is the probability that this student also plays basketball?

### Solution:

Let:
- `P(A)` be the probability of playing basketball (30% or 0.30).
- `P(B)` be the probability of playing soccer (40% or 0.40).
- `P(A ∩ B)` be the probability of playing both basketball and soccer (20% or 0.20).

The conditional probability of playing basketball given that the student plays soccer (`P(A|B)`) can be calculated using the formula:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

Substituting the given values:

 P(A|B) = 0.20 / 0.40 = 0.50 

So, the probability that a randomly chosen student who plays soccer also plays basketball is 50%.
